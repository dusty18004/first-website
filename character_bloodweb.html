            This screen lists all options for the characters that the game provides. Some of the characters are free, while others require in-game and real-world currency 
            to purchase. When you want to choose a character, click on their icon, and a green check mark will appear on their icon in the character list. 
            NOTE: You CAN own multiple characters. Once you have a character to Prestige level 1, you can share their perks with other characters you own. I will touch
            on this more when I talk about the character 
                <a href="perks.html#perks">Perks</a>

                A friend that I play with -we'll call him Hamster- plays as Trevor Belmont. With playing many games with my friend, I've learned about the beneficial
                perks that come with Trevor Belmont's character, so I purchased Trevor Belmont, and will be learning how to use his perks myself.

        <h3>
            Customizations
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Customizatons tag allows you to edit how your character looks. You can choose a whole outfit, or can customize the pieces of the outfit. You can also 
            choose charms, which are optional. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When choosing your character's outfit, keep in mind you want to blend into your environment. You will be hiding from a killer, trying to repair
            generators. It will be hard to hide if you have a brightly-colored outfit (I have personal experience with this). While designing a character's Outfit
            to be exactly what you want sounds fun, it is not recommended, especially for players that aren't experts at the game (I am not an expert, either).

            <h4>
                Aestri Yazar
            </h4>
            <h5>
                Original Outfit
            </h5>
            <p>
                Aestri has been my main character since I started playing Dead By Daylight months ago. I don't know what attracted me to her, but I fell in love with her
                the moment that I saw her. I think I loved her "Wild West" outfit, which was the first outfit that I used for her. I had to use real-world currency to
                purchase Aestri and her fancy "Wild West" outfit, shown below. I loved the ripped skirt, the boots, and the hats. I wasn't the biggest fan of the shirt, 
                but it was the only option that matched the skirt, so I bought it too. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As much as I loved this outfit, I rarely won any matches. The colors were too bright to hide in the bushes and greenery, and I would constantly be
                spotted by the Killer due to the vibrancy of my outfit (and likely a skill issue, since I was still a beginner). My hat stood out as well, which did not 
                help my ability to hide. So I made the hard decision to change my outfit, which allows me to blend in with my environment.
            </p>

                Current Outfit
            </h5>
            <p>
                This is the outfit I use for Aestri now. Without playing the game, it may seem that her outfit would stick out. In some maps, her outfit does stick out,
                but my experience playing the game helps with avoiding the killers. She does still have some bold colors, but these colors are darker and will blend in 
                with most environments. I do miss the skirt that I had before, but I do enjoy this outfit since it helps me have an advantage at winning some trials.
                Removing the hat has aided in my ability to camouflage.

                Trevor Belmont also has other outfits, which can be purchased with in-game currency and real-world currency. Neither Hamster nor myself have bought
                the other outfits for Trevor Belmont. The image below shows the outfits available in the Shop.

            Charms are an optional part of outfit customization. Charms cannot be bought via the Blood Web. They can only be obtained by completing quests, 
            prestiging characters, and participating in events. There are many charmsthat can be obtained, so I will show you what charms I have selected 
            for Aestri Yazar.

                Blood Web
            </h2>
            <p>
                The blood web is a way for a user to buy perks, offerings, items, and item add-ons for their character. As you advance through the blood web, The Entity will
                start to take over and prevent you from purchasing some of the items. The Entity is there to make you think strategically about what items, perks, or offerings 
                you want that are available in the blood web. Think carefully! <br>
                You can also buy different levels (rarity) of items, perks, and offerings.
                <ul style="background-color: lightslategray">
                    <li style="color: mediumvioletred">Pink: Ultra Rare</li>
                    <li style="color:purple">Purple: Very Rare</li>
                    <li style="color:darkblue">Blue: Rare</li>
                    <li style="color: green">Green: Uncommon</li>
                    <li style="color:saddlebrown">Brown: Common</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
                <img src="Website Pics/blood_web_first_time.png" alt="A user's first time opening a blood web. Looks like this for each character." 
                title="Opening Blood Web for the First Time" />
            

            <p>
                This is what the blood web will look like when you open it (after opening it for the first time).
            </p>
            <img src="Website Pics/aestri_blood_web.png" alt="What the blood web will look like after opening it for the first time." title="Opening the Blood Web" />
                
            <p>
                There are different blood webs for each character, so items/perks/offerings ("items") bought for one character via the blood web is not shared between all 
                other owned characters. You will have to purchase those items in the blood web for your other characters if you want them to have the same items. By 
                playing the game, you will earn Blood Points, which is the currency used for your Blood Web. To purchase an item, simply click on the item(s) you want.
                Before purchasing an item(s), you can hover over it, and a small pop-up will tell you information about the item you are hovering over. In the bottom right
                corner of the pop-up, the required blood points to spend will be shown to purchase the item. Below is an image of an item I am about to purchase from the 
                blood web for Aestri Yazar. It's a fog vial, which allows the player to release fog (which is helpful at escaping the Killer). (Peep Trevor Belmont, who
                was being played by Hamster!)

            <p>
                One more thing I'd like to touch on is Prestiging. Prestiging allows you to share perks of a character with other characters you own (which those characters
                will have to purchase in their own blood web). To prestige, you must make it through 50 levels of the blood web. You can advance levels by purchasing (most to
                all) items in the blood web level. Once you prestige, your prestige level will appear within a circle at the top left of your character menu (see the
                previous image). It will also be shown at the bottom left of your character icon when you go to your character selection menu. You can see this here in the 
                first picture of the
                    <a href="#character_selection">Character Selection</a>
                section of this page.
