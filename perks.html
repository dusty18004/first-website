            </h2>
            <p style="background-color: black">
                Perks are traits that are essential to surviving a trial. Each character is provided with 3 perks special to their character. These perks can be 
                shared with other characters you own when the character that has the traits reaches Prestige 1. I will not list all the perks, as there are 11 pages of
                perks that can be bought through the blood web, but I will list the specific perks for Trevor Belmont and Aestri Yazar, and the perks that I use for 
                Aestri in my own gameplay. <br>
                A character can use up to 4 perks. When using a characater for the first time, you can use 1 perk. As you advance through levels in the blood web, you will
                unlock more perk slots, and you can use more perks that are in your perks inventory.
