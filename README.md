# first-website
This repository is my first website that I created.
The main branch has the updated .html files for the addition of the CSS file (dbd_style.css).

# about the website
This website was created as a homework assigment, and I made it about my favorite video game, Dead by Daylight. Dead by Daylight is a cat-and-mouse type of game, 
where four survivors must repair 5 generators to open exit gates while being hunted by a killer. It's a thriller game that I have come to love with my whole heart. 
The website acts as a user's guide (for survivors) for new players, although it is not as descriptive as could be -- since it was created with a deadline rather 
than as a fun project for myself. 

## main page (index.html)
The main page holds a logo (that sends the user to the homescreen), a navigation bar for page navigation, as well as a drop-down image to show the user the main
menu of the game, and how to navigate to different menus in the game. There is also a downloadable guide created by another user of the game (dbd_guide.pdf).

## character and bloodweb page (character_bloodweb.html)
This page provides ample pictues and descriptions about character selection, "editing" outfits, and the bloodweb aspects of the game. I used two to three different
characters to show that the game aspects are consistent throughout the characters of the game. I also briefly hinted at the multiplayer portion of the game, since
some of the pictures and the background include my character, as well as my friend Hamster's character. I use links to different portions of the same page, as well
as links to other webpages of the website.

## perks page (perks.html)
This page has a short description about how perks work in the game, as well as an image showing what the perks look like. It primarily consists of multiple 
unordered lists telling the user about perks that come with my character, and the perks that I use with my character. The same lists are used with my friend 
Hamster's character as well.

## contact page (contact.html)
This page holds links to external websites to Dead by Daylight's webpage and discord server, as well as links to my personal email, steam account, discord profile,
and my phone number (I used a fake one for my privacy).

## CSS file (dbd_style.css)
This page holds the .css content for the website, making the .html files shorter and easier to read.
